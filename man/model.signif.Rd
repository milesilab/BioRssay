\title{Test the significance of dose-mortality response differences}
\usage{
model.signif(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame of probit transformed mortality data using the
function probit.trans}
}
\value{
a list with model outputs: a chi-square test if there are only two
strains or if there are more than two strains, first an overall model
assessment (i.e. one strain vs. all) and given overall model is significant,
 then a bonferroni test of significance from a pairwise model comparison.
}
\description{
This function is used when comparing at least two strains. It tests whether
 the mortality-dose regressions are similar for different strains, using a
 likelihood ratio test (LRT). If there are more than two strains, it also
 computes pairwise tests, using sequential Bonferroni correction
 (Hommel, 1988) to account for multiple testing.
}
\details{
A global LRT test assesses a strain’s effect, by comparing two
models, one with and one without this effect (i.e. comparing a model with
several strains to a model where all the data originate from a single
strain).
If there are more than two strains, pairwise tests are computed, and
p-values of significance are assessed using sequential Bonferroni correction
 (Hommel, 1988) to account for multiple testing.

Warning: We strongly encourage users to not use this function when the
dose-mortality response for at least one strain significantly deviates
from linearity (see resist.ratio() function for more details): in such
cases the test cannot be interpreted.
